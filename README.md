# Why?
## Problem
[genius.com](http://genius.com) is the world’s biggest encyclopedia of music and has some powerful base features. But when it comes to extending that functionallity, you need a lot manpower to keep pushing such a platform forward. That also takes a lot of time. 

## Solution
Community-based development has its benefits and downsides, but instead of putting more and more pressure on the official dev team and waiting for new features to come, I created geniusly because I believe in the power of community-based projects where volunteers can fiddle around and maybe these features become offical some time. And if not, well, you can still use this extension.

# Current stage
geniusly is currently in beta. So feel free to install it as described below and give some feedback.
